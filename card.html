				<p class="bold">About the Platypus</p>
				<p class="justify"> The platypus is among nature's most unlikely animals. In fact, the first 
					scientists to examine a specimen believed they were the victims of a hoax. The animal is 
					best described as a hodgepodge of more familiar species: the duck (bill and webbed feet), 
					beaver (tail), and otter (body and fur). Males are also venomous. They have sharp stingers 
					on the heels of their rear feet and can use them to deliver a strong toxic blow to any foe.</p>
