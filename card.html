					<p class="bold">About the Platypus</p>
					<p class="justify"> The platypus is among nature's most unlikely animals. In fact, the first scientists to examine a specimen believed they were
						the victims of a hoax. The animal is best described as a hodgepodge of more familiar species: the duck (bill and webbed feet), 
						beaver (tail), and otter (body and fur). Males are also venomous. They have sharp stingers on the heels of their rear feet and 
						can use them to deliver a strong toxic blow to any foe.</p>
